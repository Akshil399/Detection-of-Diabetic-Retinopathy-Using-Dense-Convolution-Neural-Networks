Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Dense Convolution Neural Networks
Various complications occur concerning eye vision. The growing problems with the lifestyle of human beings have given way to diseases like diabetes. Diabetes Mellitus, or Diabetes, is a disorder where an individual's body neglects to react to insulin delivered by their pancreas or doesn't create adequate insulin. It is important to plan for identification and forestalling this ailment among individuals living in rustic regions where clinical screening is difficult. Dark lesions are the rudimentary stages of diabetic retinopathy. When this condition enters a new stage a fluid leakage occurs in the ciliary muscle which forces the creation of new vessels. Because of this, there is a very slim possibility of recouping the eyesight loss. Due to these reasons, it is crucial to find new Spartan ways to discern the condition in the preliminary stages. The proposed method detects diabetic retinopathy and also finds out the exact grade of the severity. This gives a new dimension to finding out the stage of the disease.
