## Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe eye condition caused by diabetes, leading to vision impairment and potentially blindness. The condition begins with dark lesions and progresses to fluid leakage and the formation of new blood vessels, which can severely damage vision. Early detection is crucial for preventing severe outcomes, especially in rural areas where medical screening is less accessible.

Our project utilizes Dense Convolutional Neural Networks (DenseNet) to detect diabetic retinopathy and determine its severity. This approach offers a new dimension in identifying the disease at its initial stages, thereby improving the chances of timely intervention and treatment.
